        <h3><b>The best way to avoid getting tricked by scammers is to know the tricks they use – and the red flags that signal scams.</b></h3>
<br>
<h3><b>Know the red flags</b></h3>
<br>
<p>The most common types of scams will target you through fake emails (a technique known as phishing), text messages (SMSishing or smishing) voice calls (vishing), letters or even someone who shows up at your front door unexpectedly. No matter which technique the scammer uses, you may be:</p>
 <br>
<ul>
   <li>Pressured to send money</li><br>
   <li>Threatened with law enforcement action</li><br>
   <li>Told to purchase gift cards and provide codes as a form of payment</li><br>
   <li>Asked to cash a check for a stranger or send money via wire transfer</li><br>
   <li>Instructed to make a cash deposit for a sweepstakes</li><br>
   <li>Offered more than you’re asking for something you’re selling, with a request to send the overpayment elsewhere</li><br>

 </ul>  
 <br>
 <p>Remember: Zelle® transactions should be considered the same as cash. Zelle® should only be used to send money to friends, family or others you trust and not to buy goods or services from people you don’t know.
</p>
<br>
<h3><b>The best ways to avoid getting scammed</b></h3>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Don’t respond:</b>If you’re not 100% certain of the source of the call, email or text, then hang up the phone, don’t click on the link in the email and don’t reply to the text message.</li>
<li><b>Don’t trust caller ID or answer phone calls from unknown numbers:</b>If you recognize the caller ID but the call seems suspicious, hang up the phone. Phone numbers can be easily spoofed to appear to be from a legitimate caller.</li><br>
<li><b>Don’t give out your information:</b>Do not give out any personal identifiable information unless you’re absolutely certain the person and reason are legitimate. Remember: Bank of America will never ask you to send us personal information such as an account number, Social Security or Tax ID over text, email or online.</li><br>
<li><b>Research and validate: </b> If the individual or organization seems suspicious, make sure the request being made is legitimate by calling the organization through an official number from their website or consulting with a trusted family member or friend.</li><br>
